     Hi, I am Borsha Devi, a Junior React.js and Front-End Developer . I enjoy creating dynamic and responsive websites that give users a great experience. I have strong skills in JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3,Tailwind CSS, and frameworks like React.js. I have worked on different projects, including an e-commerce website , where I focus on writing clean code and designing for users.
     <br />
     <span >I also have experience with MongoDB, Node.js and Express.js,   which helps me build full-stack applications and style them effectively. Right now, I am learning Next.js, a React framework, to improve my ability to build faster, server-side rendered websites. I am always excited to learn new technologies and take on challenges to grow my skills. My goal is to work on projects that make a real difference.</span>
